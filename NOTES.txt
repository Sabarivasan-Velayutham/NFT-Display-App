APPROACH : 
1 ) setup app.js file by adding imports and setting up navigation settings  
2 ) created two screens : Home and Details
3 ) created constants folder for data usage 
4 ) created components folder and added FocusedSTatusBar , HomeHeader , NFTCard 

5) display NFT data on the home page using FLatList
6) first check by rendering each data as a Text (item.name)
7) after that instead of Text replace with NFT Card component , so that NFT cards are displayed 

8 ) create css for NFT cards and a circle button over it as a component 
9 ) add subinfo about the NFTs and add styles to it (subinfo.js)
10 ) subinfo has two branches  : people and enddate -> people has another link know as ImageCmp
11 ) add NFTTitle info to bottom of subinfo layer (NFTTitle.js) 
11 ) add EthPrice info to bottom of NFTTitle (EthPrice.js) 

12 ) set up the home header which is above the NFT card components
13 ) bring logo and profile picture in a single div 
14 ) in next row , create a serach bar 
15 ) all these lies within the home header
16 ) add search function for search bar in home.js file 


17 ) Details.js screen represents the whole NFT detail page 
18 ) create two components DetailsDesc.js and DetailsBid.js 
19 ) DetailsDesc.js is used for NFT Title and its description which has read more and show less functionality
20 ) DetailsBid.js is used for bid placed by other people and lies at bottom of details page



NEED TO SEE :
-> why additional file is needed for exports (index.js in constants and assets folders )
-> understand searching functionality (
    in home header , when text gets changed it calls the onSearch function again and again 
    so in home.js , the function which is passed (i.e) the function which needs to be called repeatedly is the handleSearch functionality
)


NEWLY LEARNT :
-> StatusBar from react-native 
-> isFocused from react-navigation/core
-> FLatList from react native 
-> ... purpose
